# LEBEVAL
LEBEVAL: Matlab codes for Lebesgue constant evaluation on interval, square, disk, cube, simplex and ball.

The main folder contains several subfolders that lead to the wanted domain. In particular we examine the Lebesgue constants for some interpolation sets in the

 1. interval,
 2. simplex,
 3. square,
 4. disk,
 5. cube,
 6.  ball,

as well as we analyse the Lebesgue constant for Least-Squares on 

1. square,
2. disk.


All the experiments that we run have been stored in the local folders "_DATA".
